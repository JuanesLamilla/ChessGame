After clicking start, the board and pieces will appear in their starting positions. The user can now click on the pieces, which will either flash red if the piece does not belong to the current player, or highlight all the possible moves that the selected piece can move to. Clicking on a possible move will move the selected piece to that position.

Chess is a turn based game so after every move, the other player makes the next move. This continues until a player checkmates (when the King is under attack or in "check" and every possible move by the King will also put it in check) the opponent, and the game ends. Our game do not have CPU opponents yet so it is currently a two player game only.

Since all the valid moves are highlighted, this game does not require any knowledge of chess to play. However, you can click [here](https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess) if you are interested to learn more.
